# ZeroDivisionError in Python

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError`.  The `bug.py` file contains code that causes this error, while `bugSolution.py` provides a solution.

The error occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero. This is mathematically undefined and results in a runtime exception.

The solution involves adding input validation to check if the denominator is zero before performing the division.
